# Grading Configuration for xv6-ntu-mp
# 
# [Purpose]
# This file determines which test files are counted towards the official score.
# Students are encouraged to add their own tests in the 'tests/' directory.
#
# [Official Grading]
# During official grading, the TA will OVERWRITE this file to include only
# official test cases. Any test file NOT matched by the patterns below will 
# still execute, but its points will NOT be added to the final POSSIBLE/TOTAL score.
#
# [Default Pattern]
# Match all .py and .txt files for local development.

*.py
*.txt
